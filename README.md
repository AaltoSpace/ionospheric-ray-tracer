# ionospheric-ray-tracer
Simulate the behavior of radio waves in planetary ionospheres by applying a ray tracing method

## Quickstart ##
Run the main application in src/core/main.cpp to start the simulation.

## prerequisites ##
This project makes use of the google test library gtest as well as the multithreading lib boost/thread.
Gtest is included in the source but it is required to have boost/thread installed locally. See for more
information on the boost libraries: [boost getting started](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/more/getting_started/index.html)

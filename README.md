# ionospheric-ray-tracer #
Simulate the behavior of radio waves in planetary ionospheres by applying a ray tracing method

# Background #
This simulation package is created to support the research of the use of the Martian ionosphere for
positioning systems on Mars. The package was initially developed by Rian van Gijlswijk in 2015 for his 
masters' thesis on this subject at the Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. Currently the simulation is
developed by the Space department of Aalto to further support space research and projects. 

# Setup and usage #
The setup and usage of the simulator are explained in the [wiki](https://github.com/AaltoSpace/ionospheric-ray-tracer/wiki/Home):
- The [setup guide](https://github.com/AaltoSpace/ionospheric-ray-tracer/wiki/Setup-guide) explains how to compile the product from source
- The [quickstart manual](https://github.com/AaltoSpace/ionospheric-ray-tracer/wiki/Quickstart-manual) explains how to use the product; covering the various operation modes and configuration settings.
